# cakes
A repo for the project Cakes
The intention of this code is to display polymorphic  behaviours of "Cakes" using a base class with attributes like price, size, bake, ingredients, frost, box, etc. I plan to also add the setters and getters in the base class
and then make derived classes (i'll probably just do 3 derived classes of maybe chocolate, vanilla and cheesecake)
after those I plan to add a class to organize all the previously made cakes using vector where i push them in one by one, which will also make it easier for me to test them as im planning on using assertions (despite initially planning on using gtest but it just wouldnt work) 
also im planning to set the values in the tests and just call the tests in 'main'

thats the inital plan atleast
